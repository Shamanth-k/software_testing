On Day 2, we developed a personal portfolio website to showcase our skills, projects, and achievements.
The site features sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.
It has a clean, responsive design that works well on all devices.
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also integrated FastAPI for backend functionality.
FastAPI was used to handle contact form submissions and future API integrations.
The website includes smooth scrolling, animations, and a professional layout.
It serves as a platform for career growth, internships, and networking.
The project helped us enhance both frontend and backend development skills.
This was a collaborative effort carried out as part of our learning process.
